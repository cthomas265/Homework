<p>  Throughout his career with multiple bands including; Genesis, Brand X, Flaming Youth or solo, Phil Collins has a sound to sooth the soul.
    I dont know if I have ever met a single person who doesnt like at least one Phil Collins song.
    The perfect orchestra for his voice, the instruments and the lyrics, you can feel the emotion.
    Best known as the drummer/singer of Rock band Genesis from 1970-1996 and solo work starting in 1981.
